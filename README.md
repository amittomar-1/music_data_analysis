# 🎵 Data Analysis Project #1: Music Store Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a **data-analysis pipeline** for a **music-store business scenario**. Using **PostgreSQL** (managed via **pgAdmin 4**) as the relational database engine, the workflow encompasses:

* Data ingestion
* Schema design
* Query analysis
* Business-insight generation

The focus is on analyzing data from a **hypothetical music retail environment** to extract valuable insights about customers, sales, and product performance.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to **model and explore** how a music store can track and analyze:

* Products (albums, tracks, artists)
* Customers and their behavior
* Sales trends and performance metrics
* Streaming or purchase activity

Through this analysis, we aim to demonstrate how **structured database design** and **SQL querying** can help answer key business questions, such as:

* 🎤 Which artists or albums generate the highest revenue?
* 🎧 How does customer purchase behavior vary by genre, region, or time?
* 📦 What inventory or supply decisions should the store make based on sales trends?
* 💡 Are there opportunities for cross-selling or targeted marketing based on customer segments?

## ⚙️ Technical Stack

This project uses the following tools and technologies:

* **PostgreSQL** - for storing and managing the dataset (relational tables, constraints, indexes, and SQL queries).
* **pgAdmin 4** - as the GUI tool for database administration, visualization, and query execution.
* **Dataset** - a synthetic or real-world inspired **music-store dataset** containing artists, albums, tracks, customers, and transactions.
